# Backend

This directory contains the source code for the PostgreSQL backend. The backend is the set of processes that handle client connections, execute queries, and manage data storage.

## Subdirectories

*   **access**: Contains code related to accessing and manipulating data stored in tables and indexes.
*   **archive**: Manages the archiving of Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) files.
*   **backup**: Handles physical backups of the database.
*   **bootstrap**: Deals with the initial setup and bootstrapping of a new database cluster.
*   **catalog**: Manages the system catalogs, which store metadata about database objects.
*   **commands**: Implements SQL commands like DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language).
*   **executor**: Executes query plans generated by the optimizer.
*   **foreign**: Implements support for foreign data wrappers, allowing access to external data sources.
*   **jit**: Contains the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation framework for speeding up query execution.
*   **lib**: Provides general-purpose library functions and data structures used throughout the backend.
*   **libpq**: Implements the backend portion of the libpq protocol, used for communication with client applications.
*   **main**: Contains the main entry point and global variables for the backend.
*   **nodes**: Defines and manipulates the various node structures used in parse trees, plan trees, and executor state trees.
*   **optimizer**: Analyzes queries and generates optimal execution plans.
*   **parser**: Parses SQL queries and converts them into parse trees.
*   **partitioning**: Implements table partitioning functionality.
*   **po**: Contains localization files for translating messages into different languages.
*   **port**: Provides platform-specific code and portability layers.
*   **postmaster**: Manages the overall lifecycle of the PostgreSQL server, including starting and stopping backend processes.
*   **regex**: Implements regular expression matching functionality.
*   **replication**: Handles data replication to standby servers.
*   **rewrite**: Implements the query rewrite system, used for views and rules.
*   **snowball**: Contains the Snowball stemmer libraries for text search.
*   **statistics**: Collects and manages statistics about database objects, used by the optimizer.
*   **storage**: Manages the physical storage of data on disk, including buffer management and file access.
*   **tcop**: (Traffic Cop) Handles top-level command processing and dispatch.
*   **tsearch**: Implements text search functionality.
*   **utils**: Provides various utility functions and data structures used throughout the backend.
